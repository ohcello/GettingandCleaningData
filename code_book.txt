Feature Selection 
=================

The descriptions of the original data and the data files themselves can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

In brief, the original 561 features (in features.txt) were obtained from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ captured via a Samsung smartphone via various filters, transforms, estimates, and calculations. The features are presented for 30 test subjects carrying out 6 activities. 

Original data files: features.txt, labels.txt, subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt

The final feature set includes 81 features that were arrived at in the following manner. 

All the data were originally normalized. That has not changed, so there are no units. 


=================
Variables Removed
=================
As we were only interested in measurements of the 'mean value' (names ending in mean() ), 'standard deviation'(names ending in std() ), or 'mean frequency' (names ending in meanFreq() ), any variable based on the following calculations were removed from the data, i.e., any variable whose name ended with one of the following: 

mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
*angle(): Angle between to vectors 

*While the angle calculations included quantities such as gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean, it was unclear that the resulting angle calculation was a mean (some were clearly not, such as angle(tBodyAccMean, gravity) so they were removed. 


===============
Variables Added 
===============
Activity -- character indicating which activity the measurement corresponds to: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, laying, sitting, standing (from labels.txt)

Subject -- number from 1-30 indicating which subject the measurements were taken from (from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt)


==========================
Variables kept but renamed
==========================
The following variables on the left (XYZ representing 3 variables of the same type) were renamed to the more descriptive versions on the right, as shown below. Only the mean(), std(), and meanFreq()
estimates for the variables were kept.  

tBodyAcc-XYZ 		= 	Body Acceleration along XYZ-Axis (time-domain)
tGravityAcc-XYZ		=	Gravity Acceleration along XYZ-Axis (time-domain)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ	=	Linear Body Jerk along XYZ-Axis (time-domain)
tBodyGyro-XYZ		=	Body Angular Velocity along XYZ-Axis (time-domain)
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ	=	Angular Body Jerk along XYZ-Axis (time-domain)
tBodyAccMag		=	Magnitude of Body Acceleration (time-domain)
tGravityAccMag		=	Magnitude of Gravity Acceleration (time-domain)
tBodyAccJerkMag		=	Magnitude of Linear Body Jerk (time-domain)
tBodyGyroMag		=	Magnitude of Body Angular Velocity (tim-domain)
tBodyGyroJerkMag	=	Magnitude of Angular Body Jerk (time-domain)
fBodyAcc-XYZ		=	Body Acceleration along XYZ-Axis (frequency-domain)
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ	=	Linear Body Jerk along XYZ-Axis (frequency-domain)
fBodyGyro-XYZ		=	Body Angular Acceleration along XYZ-Axis (frequency-domain)
fBodyAccMag		=	Magnitude of Body Acceleration (frequency-domain)
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag	=	Magnitude of Linear Body-Body Jerk (frequency-domain)
fBodyBodyGyroMag	=	Magnitude of Body-Body Angular Velocity (frequency-domain)
fBodyGyroJerkMag	=	Magnitude of Angular Body-Body Jerk (frequency-domain)

=======================
Transformations applied
=======================
Multiple measurements per subject per activity per variable were condensed by calculating the mean value. So only one measurement is presented per subject per activity per variable. For example, for subject 1, only one mean value is presented for "Body Acceleration along X-Axis (time-domain)" for the activity of "Walking". As each of the multiple measurements are means over a set time period, when we take the mean of the means we end up with the standard mean as a result.
